TagTypes

ingredientn
starascending
stardescending
type
mealplantype

create list of all tags - slots (and proposal)
do count of mealplanes per tag
tally tag count per slot
start with slot with lowest count

outer join for each tag in slot - count and total
  order by total, desc.



rest calls for lists

user creates a base list / pick up list
    POST list?type=BaseList|PickUpList

user adds / deletes tags to a base list / pick up list
    POST list/id/tag/tag_id
    DELETE list/id/tag/tag_id

user generates an active list
    POST list?generateType=replace|add&type=Active

user crosses off items from an active list
    PUT list/id/tag/tag_id


general note

    clean up - not much checking for null userids, null values in calls, etc.
        needs a pass through with tests trying to break.
