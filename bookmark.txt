defaults -
    need default for listlayouttype
    default / switch for add lists upon generate
bugs -
    dishes with every tag added twice - I suspect tag assign tool

bigger todo list
    done set in process list active
        "page" for active list (only cross out, not delete)
        back end "set active" generateStrategy=replace|add

    list - cross out function

    dish retrieves tags only when single dish

    done statistics for what's crossed out often

    done - non-grocery items

    done list layouts

    bulk organizing tools -
        slots to tag structure (dnd)
        slots to layouts
        mass dishes to slots

    done - implement last added to list for dishes

    target

    recipe

    smoothing front end


little things
    add created on to dish entity



sketch for menu finding algorithm

TagTypes

ingredientn
starascending
stardescending
type
mealplantype

create list of all slots - slots (and proposal)
do count of dishes per tag
tally tag count per slot
start with slot with lowest count

outer join for each tag in slot - count and total
  order by total, desc.



rest calls for lists

user creates a base list / pick up list
    POST list?type=BaseList|PickUpList

user adds / deletes slots to a base list / pick up list
    POST list/id/tag/tag_id
    DELETE list/id/tag/tag_id

user generates an active list
    POST list?generateType=replace|add&type=Active

user crosses off items from an active list
    PUT list/id/tag/tag_id


general note

    clean up - not much checking for null userids, null values in calls, etc.
        needs a pass through with tests trying to break.
